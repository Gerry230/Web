        <p>Python provides efficient high-level data structures, as well as simple and efficient object-oriented programming. Python syntax and dynamic typing, as well as the nature of an interpreted language, make it a programming language for scripting and rapid application development on most platforms. development of the project.</p>  
      <p>The content we teach revolves around the development of Python, for which we have strong faculty and high achievement in the field.</p>

        <p>This course is mainly to help students become an excellent web front-end development engineer. A good web front-end development engineer must have both breadth and depth in the knowledge system, so it is difficult for many large companies to recruit ideal front-end development engineers even with high salaries. No matter in terms of development difficulty or development method, current web page production is closer to traditional website back-end development, so it is no longer called web page production, but web front-end development.</p>
        <p>
          The role of web front-end development in product development is becoming more and more important, and professional front-end engineers are needed to do it well. Professionals in this field have been favored in the past two years. Web front-end development is a very special job, covering a wide range of knowledge, both specific technologies and abstract concepts. Simply put, its main function is to better present the interface of the website to users.

        <p>Java is an object-oriented programming language. It not only absorbs various advantages of C++ language, but also abandons the incomprehensible concepts of multiple inheritance and pointers in C++. Therefore, Java language has two characteristics of powerful functions and ease of use. As a representative of static object-oriented programming language, Java language perfectly implements object-oriented theory, allowing programmers to perform complex programming in an elegant way of thinking.
The Java we learn in our course is characterized by simplicity, object orientation, distribution, robustness, security, platform independence and portability, multithreading, and dynamics. We can use Java to write desktop applications, web applications, distributed system and embedded system applications etc.</p>

        <p>UI design (or interface design) refers to the overall design of software human-computer interaction, operation logic, and beautiful interface. UI design is divided into physical UI and virtual UI. The commonly used UI design on the Internet is virtual UI, and UI is the abbreviation of User Interface.</p>
<p>A good UI design not only makes the software personal and tasteful, but also makes the operation of the software comfortable, simple and free, fully reflecting the positioning and characteristics of the software.</p>

        <p>Network security usually refers to the security of computer networks, in fact, it can also refer to the security of computer communication networks. A computer communication network is a system that interconnects several computers with independent functions through communication equipment and transmission media, and realizes information transmission and exchange between computers with the support of communication software. The computer network refers to a system that uses communication means to connect several independent computer systems, terminal equipment and data equipment that are relatively scattered in the region for the purpose of sharing resources, and exchanges data under the control of the protocol. The fundamental purpose of computer network is resource sharing, and communication network is the way to realize network resource sharing. Therefore, computer network is safe, and the corresponding computer communication network must also be safe. It should be able to realize information exchange and resource sharing for network users.</p>

        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), abbreviated as AI. It is a new technical science that studies and develops theories, methods, techniques and application systems for simulating, extending and expanding human intelligence.</p>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that attempts to understand the essence of intelligence and produce a new kind of intelligent machine that can respond in a similar way to human intelligence. Research in this field includes robotics, language recognition, image recognition, Natural language processing and expert systems, etc. Since the birth of artificial intelligence, the theory and technology have become more and more mature, and the application field has also continued to expand. It is conceivable that the technological products brought by artificial intelligence in the future will be the "container" of human intelligence. Artificial intelligence can simulate the information process of human consciousness and thinking. Artificial intelligence is not human intelligence, but it can think like human beings and may surpass human intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artificial intelligence is an extremely challenging science, and those who do it must understand computer literacy, psychology, and philosophy. Artificial intelligence is a very broad science, which consists of different fields, such as machine learning, computer vision, etc. Generally speaking, one of the main goals of artificial intelligence research is to enable machines to be capable of doing things that normally require human intelligence. complex work.
